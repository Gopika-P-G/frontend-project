     <p>
            It’s time to change the narrative surround forests and fire.  We can change the outcomes of thesires now, and in the future.  The firestorm in California has ignited a debate.  Unfortunately, the ones getting the attention aren’t always the right voices.  This isn’t about clearcutting our forests.When President Trump tweeted about the need to manage our forests to stop wildfires he was right on by most accounts.  He didn’t didn’t capture everything, but seems to get the gist.  Coming from a man that has lived in New York City and Florida most of his life, I’m happy to see him drawing attention to the issue.  The part that is missing is that many of these landscapes are naturally prone to fire.  Unfortunately the fire behavior has changed from low-to-moderate intensity to very high intensity.</p>
